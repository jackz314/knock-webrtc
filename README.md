# Knock WebRTC Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jackz314/knock-webrtc.svg?token=phWsgHBzUvb6jweQrYva&branch=knock-branch)](https://travis-ci.com/jackz314/knock-webrtc)

### This is a custom built WebRTC library based on the official one with extra feature support

### Functionalities
- Android Native API Camera control (Via [CameraCaptureSession](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/camera2/CameraCaptureSession.html))

**WebRTC is a free, open software project** that provides browsers and mobile
applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs.
The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.

**Our mission:** To enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be
developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them
all to communicate via a common set of protocols.

The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera,
amongst others.

### Development

See http://www.webrtc.org/native-code/development for instructions on how to get
started developing with the native code.
